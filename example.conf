; THIS IS THE EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION FILE. YOU SHOULD NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY.
; The proper way is to copy this file or create a new one, and specify the file
; by calling the bot with the new file as the value for the -c parameter.

; Bot Basics - Basic things for the bot to run properly.
;   log_file           - The log file to log bot output
;   command_flag       - The prefix character to denote a bot command
;   bot_owner_nick     - The nickname of the bot owner
;   bot_owner_hostname - The hostname of the bot owner
log_file = ""
command_flag = "!"
bot_owner_nick = ""
bot_owner_hostname = ""
base_dir = ""
addons_dir = ""

; IRC Configuration - IRC Server Information and Bot Identity
; Note: The bot CANNOT register itself - you must have a registered account
; and password to use here.
;   timezone - The timezone for the bot; MUST be a valid PHP timezone value (https://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php)
;   server   - The IRC server you want to use to connect, e.g. irc.libera.chat
;   port     - The port to use. Until I get SSL/TLS working, probably 6667
;   channel  - The channel to connect to, including the #
;   nickname - The bot's nickname
;   password - The bot's NickServ password. If blank bot will not try to identify with services.
timezone = "UTC"
server   = "some.irc.server"
port     = "6667"
channel  = "#cIRCuitbot"
nickname = "cIRCuitbot"
password = ""

; Database - Settings for database connection
;   dbserver - The database server; if running bot and database from same server, use localhost or 127.0.0.1
;   dbuser   - The username for the database connection
;   dbpass   - The password for the database connection
;   db       - The name of the database
dbserver = "localhost"
dbuser   = "someuser"
dbpass   = "somepassword"
db       = "cIRCuitbot"

; Bridge Support - Enable support for a bridged setup
; It is common to see IRC channels with a bot that bridges, or relays, messages between
; IRC and another chat service such as Discord, TeamSpeak, Mumble, etc. 
; Enabling bridge support is EXPERIMENTAL!
; Note: Some bridge bots have a setting to inject hidden null characters in the nickname. 
;       This must be DISABLED or this will all blow up in your face.
;
;   bridge_enabled              - true/false value, if enabled the other settings are REQUIRED except the user prefix
;   bridge_username             - The username of the bridge bot
;   bridge_hostname             - The hostname of the bridge bot
;   bridge_left_delimeter       - The LEFT character used to surround the bridge user nickname (e.g. the "<" in "<BridgeUser>")
;   bridge_right_delimeter      - The RIGHT character used to surround the bridge user nickname (e.g. the ">" in "<BridgeUser>")
;   bridge_user_prefix          - The prefix to add to the username that is in between the left and right delimeters (e.g. "@BridgeUser", so they get tagged on the other side)
;   bridge_user_hostname_prefix - The prefix for the hostname to be used for users chatting over the bridge
;   bridge_user_hostname_middle - The middle of the hostname to be used for users chatting over the bridge; CAN ONLY BE:
;                                   - user : Use the username of the user (NOT the bridge bot), truncated to 12 characters and cleaned up (no spaces, etc).
;                                   - hash : Generates an MD5 hash of the user's username (cleaned) and uses the first 2 characters of the bridge bot's 
;                                            username + a dash + 12 characters of the hash. This should maintain uniqueness per-user.
;   bridge_user_hostname_suffic - The suffix of the hostname to be used for users chatting over the bridge.

; Triggers - Load extra triggers
; Triggers are a type of addon that are not invoked by a command, but are instead triggered by other means such
; as the bot detecting a URL in a chat message and parsing the URL to grab the page title.
; Triggers must follow a standard, or they will not work. All triggers must be included in the triggers[] array,
; and must be contained in a folder in the 'triggers' directory. The name of that folder is what you place here.
;   triggers[] - Each trigger you want to load must be on its own line and start with this!
triggers[] = ""

; Modules - Load extra modules
; Modules are a type of addon that are invoked by a user sending a command.
